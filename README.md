# Mix Master (Spotify)
<b><i>Deployed at:</i></b> <a href=https://mix-master.netlify.app/ target="_blank">https://mix-master.netlify.app/</a>. <br>

This is project intended to help users make better playlists and mixes, by looking at key and tempo data of a chosen Spotify playlist. A good mix transitions between tracks that are similar in key and tempo (based on Circle of Fifths), this site helps you do this. A guide for using the site can be found in the 'About' section. <br>

Note that all data comes from Spotify, and will only be accurate.

It is built with React, and styled using Material-UI. Requests are done using axios, and Spotify-authorisation is done completely client-side using the Client Credentials Authorisation Flow.

<h4>Features</h4>

* Choose any playlist that you have created or followed, and
* Sort by key, tempo, or tempo and key.
* Display key in standard or Camelot, which is a system that lets you understand keys that are close together without having to know musical theory (circle of fifths).
